# Privacy Policy for GHF Express

Last updated: January 27, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **USC Computer Services** (“**we**,” “**us**,” “**our**”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use the **GHF Express** iOS application (the “**App**”) and related services (collectively, the “**Service**”).

By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

---

## 1. Overview (Plain-English Summary)

- **No accounts / no login:** The App does not require you to create an account or sign in.
- **No ads:** We do not show ads.
- **Analytics only:** We use **Firebase Analytics** to understand general App usage and improve stability/performance.
- **Membership ID stored locally:** If you enter a membership ID, it is stored **only on your device** in the App’s local preferences so the App can show your barcode again later.
- **No user content:** We do not collect files, photos, messages, contacts, or other user-generated content.

---

## 2. Definitions

- **Personal Data**: Information that identifies or can reasonably be linked to an individual.
- **Usage Data**: Information collected automatically about how the App is used (e.g., device details, app interactions, diagnostics).
- **Service Providers**: Third parties that process information on our behalf (e.g., analytics providers).

---

## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 Membership ID (stored locally on your device)

The App allows you to enter a **membership ID** to generate and display a barcode for your convenience.

- The membership ID is stored **locally on your device** as part of the App’s data (preferences) so it persists between launches.
- **We do not transmit your membership ID to our servers** as part of normal operation.
- The membership ID is used only to display your barcode within the App.

You can remove the locally stored membership ID by using the App’s delete/remove option (if available) or by uninstalling the App.

### 3.2 Usage Data (Analytics & Diagnostics)

When you use the App, we (and our analytics provider) may collect **Usage Data** automatically, such as:

- App interactions (e.g., screens viewed, taps, feature usage)
- App performance and crash/diagnostic information
- Device and system details (e.g., device model, iOS version, app version, language/region)
- Approximate network/location signals derived from your IP address (typical for internet communications)

We use **Firebase Analytics** to help us understand App usage and improve performance and reliability. While we do not send your membership ID to Firebase Analytics, analytics systems may collect certain identifiers and technical information required to provide analytics and protect against abuse.

---

## 4. How We Use Information

We use the information described above to:

- **Operate and maintain** the App
- **Understand usage trends** and improve features and user experience
- **Improve reliability and security**, including diagnosing crashes and fixing bugs

We do **not** use your information for targeted advertising.

---

## 5. How We Share Information

We may share information only as described below:

### 5.1 Service Providers (Firebase Analytics)

We share Usage Data with **Firebase Analytics** to help us understand App usage and improve performance. Firebase processes this information under its own terms and privacy policy.

### 5.2 Legal and Safety

We may disclose information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to:

- Comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal process
- Protect the rights, safety, and security of users, the Service, or the public
- Prevent or investigate suspected fraud, abuse, or security incidents

### 5.3 Business Changes

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

---

## 6. Tracking and Advertising

- **No ads:** We do not serve ads in the App.
- **No cross-app tracking:** We do not “track” you across other companies’ apps and websites for advertising or measurement purposes.

---

## 7. Data Retention

- **Membership ID (on-device):** Stored on your device until you delete it in the App (if available) or uninstall the App.
- **Analytics/diagnostic data:** Retained for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this policy and according to the retention controls available in our analytics tools.

We may retain aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

---

## 8. Your Choices

- You can remove the locally stored membership ID by using the App’s delete/remove option (if available) or by uninstalling the App.
- You can limit certain device-level analytics sharing through iOS settings (varies by iOS version and configuration).

## 9. Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 10. Children’s Privacy

The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided Personal Data to us, contact us and we will take steps to delete it.
